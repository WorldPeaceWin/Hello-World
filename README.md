# Hello-World
My little Space to Extend Peace to the World
Welcome to my little space and efforts for World Peace based on LOVE, Honor, Equality and Dignity for All.
About me personally, I am just a person in Love with Work, Education and Exercise with all things dedicated towards World Peace.
I love knowledge and technology as a consuming part of the search for more knowledge.
I welcome all who come in Peace with a desire to give and share, park big egos and other negative emotions elsewhere.
I am semi-retired so I can spend 8-12 hours a day studying but have not a second to waste on things about entertainment/sports.

I am a participant on memrise.com and a student of languages, English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Indonesian and others.

I am also a student of speed reading and memory enhancing technology. I am a student of Ace Speed Reader and J. Foer's memory techs.

I have recently completed a great course in Learning how to Learn on Coursera, it changed much about how I think, study and learn.

I have mastered techniques to greatly enhance language learning skills on Memrise.

I HAVE SKYPE BUT RARELY USE IT NOR THE PHONES(I HAVE 3, USE NONE),! I DO RAPID EMAIL RESPONSES.
